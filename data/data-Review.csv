10;The fries were great too.;1066
11;A great touch.  1;1045
12;Service was very prompt.;1116
13;Would not go back.;140
14;The cashier had no care what so ever on what I had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced.;1133
15;I tried the Cape Cod ravoli, chicken, with cranberry...mmmm!;505
16;I was disgusted because I was pretty sure that was human hair.;982
17;I was shocked because no signs indicate cash only.;685
18;Highly recommended.;459
19;Waitress was a little slow in service.;547
20;This place is not worth your time, let alone Vegas.;776
21;did not like at all.;491
22;The Burrittos Blah!;272
23;The food, amazing.;697
24;Service is also cute.;200
25;I could care less... The interior is just beautiful.;695
26;So they performed.;22
27;That's right....the red velvet cake.....ohhh this stuff is so good.;56
28;- They never brought a salad we asked for.;460
29;This hole in the wall has great Mexican street tacos, and friendly staff.;262
30;Took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was Luke warm, Our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed.;709
31;The worst was the salmon sashimi.;582
32;Also there are combos like a burger, fries, and beer for 23 which is a decent deal.;1157
33;This was like the final blow!;115
34;I found this place by accident and I could not be happier.;1057
35;seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food, but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.;671
36;Overall, I like this place a lot.;691
37;The only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive.;53
38;Ample portions and good prices.;120
39;Poor service, the waiter made me feel like I was stupid every time he came to the table.;930
40;My first visit to Hiro was a delight!;1059
41;Service sucks.;228
42;The shrimp tender and moist.;90
43;There is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again.;1063
44;Hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didn't want to eat it for fear of getting sick.;198
45;On a positive note, our server was very attentive and provided great service.;1113
46;Frozen pucks of disgust, with some of the worst people behind the register.;498
47;The only thing I did like was the prime rib and dessert section.;942
48;It's too bad the food is so damn generic.;108
49;The burger is good beef, cooked just right.;690
50;If you want a sandwich just go to any Firehouse!!!!!;71
51;My side Greek salad with the Greek dressing was so tasty, and the pita and hummus was very refreshing.;224
52;We ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside.;551
53;He came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table.;764
54;Their chow mein is so good!;257
55;They have horrible attitudes towards customers, and talk down to each one when customers don't enjoy their food.;674
56;The portion was huge!;1143
57;Loved it...friendly servers, great food, wonderful and imaginative menu.;1061
58;The Heart Attack Grill in downtown Vegas is an absolutely flat-lined excuse for a restaurant.;618
59;Not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom.;1002
60;The salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop, which was perfectly cooked.;1106
61;The ripped banana was not only ripped, but petrified and tasteless.;452
62;At least think to refill my water before I struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes.;1122
63;This place receives stars for their APPETIZERS!!!;1114
64;The cocktails are all handmade and delicious.;407
65;We'd definitely go back here again.;1152
66;We are so glad we found this place.;822
67;Great food and service, huge portions and they give a military discount.;809
68;Always a great time at Dos Gringos!;713
69;Update.....went back for a second time and it was still just as amazing;20
70;We got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy.;909
71;A great way to finish a great.;564
72;The deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks, and Jeff went above and beyond what we expected.;771
73;- Really, really good rice, all the time.;653
74;The service was meh.;975
75;It took over 30 min to get their milkshake, which was nothing more than chocolate milk.;748
76;I guess I should have known that this place would suck, because it is inside of the Excalibur, but I didn't use my common sense.;800
77;The scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well.;895
78;2 times - Very Bad Customer Service !;394
79;The sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well.;645
80;Today is the second time I've been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good.;418
81;There is so much good food in Vegas that I feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to Rice and Company.;737
82;Coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties can't wait for the other person to ask to break up.;357
83;walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating.;309
84;The turkey and roast beef were bland.;1070
85;This place has it!;314
86;The pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old.;438
87;I love the Pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try.;317
88;The poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying.;897
89;All I have to say is the food was amazing!!!;953
90;Omelets are to die for!;739
91;Everything was fresh and delicious!;706
92;In summary, this was a largely disappointing dining experience.;122
93;It's like a really sexy party in your mouth, where you're outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party.;359
94;Never been to Hard Rock Casino before, WILL NEVER EVER STEP FORWARD IN IT AGAIN!;1000
95;Best breakfast buffet!!!;838
96;say bye bye to your tip lady!;107
97;We'll never go again.;1150
98;Will be back again!;264
99;Food arrived quickly!;548
100;It was not good.;961
101;On the up side, their cafe serves really good food.;210
102;Our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow, he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go!;1159
103;The only good thing was our waiter, he was very helpful and kept the bloddy mary's coming.;1075
104;Best Buffet in town, for the price you cannot beat it.;212
105;I LOVED their mussels cooked in this wine reduction, the duck was tender, and their potato dishes were delicious.;730
106;This is one of the better buffets that I have been to.;496
107;So we went to Tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon!;255
108;The food was delicious, our bartender was attentive and personable AND we got a great deal!;321
109;The ambience is wonderful and there is music playing.;147
110;Will go back next trip out.;12
111;Sooooo good!!;1105
112;REAL sushi lovers, let's be honest - Yama is not that good.;254
113;At least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving, and it wasn't that busy.;983
114;This is a really fantastic Thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit.;105
115;Nice, spicy and tender.;722
116;Good prices.;375
117;Check it out.;854
118;It was pretty gross!;121
119;I've had better atmosphere.;1154
120;Kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did.;842
121;Although I very much liked the look and sound of this place, the actual experience was a bit disappointing.;74
122;I just don't know how this place managed to served the blandest food I have ever eaten when they are preparing Indian cuisine.;858
123;Worst service to boot, but that is the least of their worries.;242
124;Service was fine and the waitress was friendly.;111
125;The guys all had steaks, and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak he's ever eaten.;114
126;We thought you'd have to venture further away to get good sushi, but this place really hit the spot that night.;209
127;Host staff were, for lack of a better word, BITCHES!;777
128;Bland... Not a liking this place for a number of reasons and I don't want to waste time on bad reviewing.. I'll leave it at that...;489
129;Phenomenal food, service and ambiance.;1046
130;I wouldn't return.;334
131;Definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly, will return next time I'm in Vegas.;704
132;This place is way too overpriced for mediocre food.;1101
133;Penne vodka excellent!;811
134;They have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich, a crispy chicken wrap, a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers.;1160
135;The management is rude.;519
136;Delicious NYC bagels, good selections of cream cheese, real Lox with capers even.;190
137;Great Subway, in fact it's so good when you come here every other Subway will not meet your expectations.;478
138;I had a seriously solid breakfast here.;555
139;This is one of the best bars with food in Vegas.;611
140;He was extremely rude and really, there are so many other restaurants I would love to dine at during a weekend in Vegas.;992
141;My drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions.;353
142;Don't do it!!!!;649
143;The waiter wasn't helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us.;143
144;My husband and I ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service.;385
145;And the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasn't very tasty to me.;285
146;Nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food.;395
147;The bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated.;1115
148;The menu is always changing, food quality is going down & service is extremely slow.;379
149;The service was a little slow , considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace.;623
150;I give it 2 thumbs down;433
151;We watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us.;393
152;My fiancé and I came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away.;59
153;This is a great restaurant at the Mandalay Bay.;576
154;We waited for forty five minutes in vain.;539
155;Crostini that came with the salad was stale.;658
156;Some highlights : Great quality nigiri here!;384
157;the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean.;303
158;this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored.;1141
159;I ordered the Voodoo pasta and it was the first time I'd had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago.;55
160;this place is good.;1144
161;Unfortunately, we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was STALE.;609
162;I came back today since they relocated and still not impressed.;324
163;I was seated immediately.;13
164;Their menu is diverse, and reasonably priced.;462
165;Avoid at all cost!;152
166;Restaurant is always full but never a wait.;148
167;DELICIOUS!!;932
168;This place is hands-down one of the best places to eat in the Phoenix metro area.;718
169;So don't go there if you are looking for good food...;235
170;I've never been treated so bad.;499
171;Bacon is hella salty.;786
172;We also ordered the spinach and avocado salad, the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste.;523
173;This really is how Vegas fine dining used to be, right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed.;1060
174;The waitresses are very friendly.;310
175;Lordy, the Khao Soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers!;335
176;Everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter.;41
177;Perhaps I caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews, but I'm not inspired to go back.;186
178;The service here leaves a lot to be desired.;5
179;The atmosphere is modern and hip, while maintaining a touch of coziness.;893
180;Not a weekly haunt, but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while.;316
181;We literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order.;181
182;The burger had absolutely no flavor - the meat itself was totally bland, the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor.;717
183;I also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack.;86
184;I dressed up to be treated so rudely!;1078
185;It was probably dirt.;948
186;Love this place, hits the spot when I want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor.;735
187;I ordered the Lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible.;138
188;The food sucked, which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined.;383
189;Interesting decor.;356
190;What I really like there is the crepe station.;1076
191;Also were served hot bread and butter, and home made potato chips with bacon bits on top....very original and very good.;16
192;you can watch them preparing the delicious food!);620
193;Both of the egg rolls were fantastic.;367
194;When my order arrived, one of the gyros was missing.;719
195;I had a salad with the wings, and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied.;103
196;I'm not really sure how Joey's was voted best hot dog in the Valley by readers of Phoenix Magazine.;65
197;The best place to go for a tasty bowl of Pho!;945
198;The live music on Fridays totally blows.;481
199;I've never been more insulted or felt disrespected.;767
200;Very friendly staff.;871
201;It is worth the drive.;149
202;I had heard good things about this place, but it exceeding every hope I could have dreamed of.;313
203;Food was great and so was the serivce!;1139
204;The warm beer didn't help.;54
205;Great brunch spot.;946
206;Service is friendly and inviting.;333
207;Very good lunch spot.;168
208;I've lived here since 1979 and this was the first (and last) time I've stepped foot into this place.;573
209;The WORST EXPERIENCE EVER.;307
210;Must have been an off night at this place.;947
211;The sides are delish - mixed mushrooms, yukon gold puree, white corn - beateous.;423
212;If that bug never showed up I would have given a 4 for sure, but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen.;922
213;For about 10 minutes, we we're waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasn't coming any time soon.;241
214;My friend loved the salmon tartar.;849
215;Won't go back.;545
216;Extremely Tasty!;847
217;Waitress was good though!;700
218;Soggy and not good.;543
219;The Jamaican mojitos are delicious.;667
220;Which are small and not worth the price.;6
221;- the food is rich so order accordingly.;137
222;The shower area is outside so you can only rinse, not take a full shower, unless you don't mind being nude for everyone to see!;744
223;The service was a bit lacking.;768
224;Lobster Bisque, Bussell Sprouts, Risotto, Filet ALL needed salt and pepper..and of course there is none at the tables.;825
225;Hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in.;1079
226;It was either too cold, not enough flavor or just bad.;208
227;I loved the bacon wrapped dates.;1067
228;This is an unbelievable BARGAIN!;304
229;The folks at Otto always make us feel so welcome and special.;322
230;As for the 'mains,' also uninspired.;1147
231;This is the place where I first had pho and it was amazing!!;43
232;This wonderful experience made this place a must-stop whenever we are in town again.;320
233;If the food isn't bad enough for you, then enjoy dealing with the world's worst/annoying drunk people.;699
234;Very very fun chef.;648
235;Ordered a double cheeseburger & got a single patty that was falling apart (picture uploaded) Yeah, still sucks.;807
236;Great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with TV's.;1052
237;If it were possible to give them zero stars, they'd have it.;127
238;The descriptions said 'yum yum sauce' and another said 'eel sauce', yet another said 'spicy mayo'...well NONE of the rolls had sauces on them.;225
239;I'd say that would be the hardest decision... Honestly, all of M's dishes taste how they are supposed to taste (amazing).;419
240;If she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed... Not sure if we will go back and try it again.;236
241;Everyone is very attentive, providing excellent customer service.;827
242;Horrible - don't waste your time and money.;540
243;Now this dish was quite flavourful.;973
244;By this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse.;81
245;(It wasn't busy either) Also, the building was FREEZING cold.;463
246;like the other reviewer said 'you couldn't pay me to eat at this place again.';1132
247;-Drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point.;1097
248;Seriously flavorful delights, folks.;502
249;Much better than the other AYCE sushi place I went to in Vegas.;839
250;The lighting is just dark enough to set the mood.;843
251;Based on the sub-par service I received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business I won't be going back.;290
252;Owner's are really great people.!;749
253;There is nothing privileged about working/eating there.;857
254;The Greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful.;549
255;Overall, I don't think that I would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that I silently felt too.;619
256;Now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty.;599
257;We had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast.;997
258;Fantastic service here.;217
259;I as well would've given godfathers zero stars if possible.;676
260;They know how to make them here.;132
261;very tough and very short on flavor!;745
262;I hope this place sticks around.;826
263;I have been in more than a few bars in Vegas, and do not ever recall being charged for tap water.;635
264;The restaurant atmosphere was exquisite.;814
265;Good service, very clean, and inexpensive, to boot!;1085
266;The seafood was fresh and generous in portion.;274
267;Plus, it's only 8 bucks.;987
268;The service was not up to par, either.;123
269;Thus far, have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time.;580
270;Just as good as when I had it more than a year ago!;612
271;For a self proclaimed coffee cafe, I was wildly disappointed.;386
272;The Veggitarian platter is out of this world!;678
273;You cant go wrong with any of the food here.;404
274;You can't beat that.;1072
275;Stopped by this place while in Madison for the Ironman, very friendly, kind staff.;1050
276;The chefs were friendly and did a good job.;666
277;I've had better, not only from dedicated boba tea spots, but even from Jenni Pho.;702
278;I liked the patio and the service was outstanding.;1020
279;The goat taco didn't skimp on the meat and wow what FLAVOR!;246
280;I think not again;914
281;I had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so I will not be getting that again.;560
282;I went to Bachi Burger on a friend's recommendation and was not disappointed.;1064
283;Service stinks here!;295
284;I waited and waited.;626
285;This place is not quality sushi, it is not a quality restaurant.;636
286;I would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza.;329
287;Great Pizza and Salads!;409
288;Things that went wrong: - They burned the saganaki.;852
289;We waited an hour for what was a breakfast I could have done 100 times better at home.;339
290;This place is amazing!;951
291;I hate to disagree with my fellow Yelpers, but my husband and I were so disappointed with this place.;817
292;Waited 2 hours & never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did!;368
293;Just don't know why they were so slow.;583
294;The staff is great, the food is delish, and they have an incredible beer selection.;195
295;I live in the neighborhood so I am disappointed I won't be back here, because it is a convenient location.;833
296;I didn't know pulled pork could be soooo delicious.;529
297;You get incredibly fresh fish, prepared with care.;988
298;Before I go in to why I gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at Bachi burger before writing a review.;439
299;I love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it.;874
300;Never again will I be dining at this place!;175
301;The food was excellent and service was very good.;240
302;Good beer & drink selection and good food selection.;605
303;Please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles.;738
304;The potato chip order was sad... I could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12.;677
305;Food was really boring.;912
306;Good Service-check!;482
307;This greedy corporation will NEVER see another dime from me!;464
308;Will never, ever go back.;406
309;As much as I'd like to go back, I can't get passed the atrocious service and will never return.;441
310;In the summer, you can dine in a charming outdoor patio - so very delightful.;759
311;I did not expect this to be so good!;731
312;Fantastic food!;779
313;She ordered a toasted English muffin that came out untoasted.;44
314;The food was very good.;1138
315;Never going back.;570
316;Great food for the price, which is very high quality and house made.;878
317;The bus boy on the other hand was so rude.;877
318;By this point, my friends and I had basically figured out this place was a joke and didn't mind making it publicly and loudly known.;28
319;Back to good BBQ, lighter fare, reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways.;971
320;And considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about $20, you just can't go wrong.;495
321;All the bread is made in-house!;880
322;The only downside is the service.;509
323;Also, the fries are without a doubt the worst fries I've ever had.;104
324;Service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews.;332
325;A couple of months later, I returned and had an amazing meal.;301
326;Favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma!!!!!!;660
327;The black eyed peas and sweet potatoes... UNREAL!;360
328;You won't be disappointed.;136
329;They could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish, but it was still very good.;101
330;I go to far too many places and I've never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast, especially for $4.00.;92
331;When my mom and I got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad.;1082
332;The servers are not pleasant to deal with and they don't always honor Pizza Hut coupons.;330
333;Both of them were truly unbelievably good, and I am so glad we went back.;990
334;We had fantastic service, and were pleased by the atmosphere.;469
335;Everything was gross.;251
336;I love this place.;85
337;Great service and food.;1153
338;First - the bathrooms at this location were dirty- Seat covers were not replenished & just plain yucky!!!;135
339;The burger... I got the 'Gold Standard' a $17 burger and was kind of disappointed.;757
340;OMG, the food was delicioso!;500
341;There is nothing authentic about this place.;894
342;the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever.;363
343;Of all the dishes, the salmon was the best, but all were great.;905
344;The vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic Thai.;348
345;It's worth driving up from Tucson!;590
346;The selection was probably the worst I've seen in Vegas.....there was none.;188
347;Pretty good beer selection too.;146
348;This place is like Chipotle, but BETTER.;836
349;Classy/warm atmosphere, fun and fresh appetizers, succulent steaks (Baseball steak!!!!!;862
350;5 stars for the brick oven bread app!;354
351;I have eaten here multiple times, and each time the food was delicious.;157
352;We sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left.;627
353;He was terrible!;75
354;Everyone is treated equally special.;765
355;It shouldn't take 30 min for pancakes and eggs.;682
356;It was delicious!!!;834
357;On the good side, the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic - a real treat.;846
358;Sadly, Gordon Ramsey's Steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to Vegas.;142
359;As always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious!;412
360;Best fish I've ever had in my life!;746
361;(The bathroom is just next door and very nice.);36
362;The buffet is small and all the food they offered was BLAND.;1018
363;This is an Outstanding little restaurant with some of the Best Food I have ever tasted.;436
364;Pretty cool I would say.;981
365;Definitely a turn off for me & i doubt I'll be back unless someone else is buying.;881
366;Server did a great job handling our large rowdy table.;23
367;I find wasting food to be despicable, but this just wasn't food.;97
368;My wife had the Lobster Bisque soup which was lukewarm.;445
369;Would come back again if I had a sushi craving while in Vegas.;1108
370;The staff are great, the ambiance is great.;189
371;He deserves 5 stars.;1124
372;I left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day.;770
373;They dropped more than the ball.;899
374;The dining space is tiny, but elegantly decorated and comfortable.;890
375;They will customize your order any way you'd like, my usual is Eggplant with Green Bean stir fry, love it!;1087
376;And the beans and rice were mediocre at best.;93
377;Best tacos in town by far!!;261
378;I took back my money and got outta there.;534
379;In an interesting part of town, this place is amazing.;939
380;RUDE & INCONSIDERATE MANAGEMENT.;29
381;The staff are now not as friendly, the wait times for being served are horrible, no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes.;162
382;I won't be back.;34
383;They have great dinners.;84
384;The service was outshining & I definitely recommend the Halibut.;1035
385;The food was terrible.;783
386;WILL NEVER EVER GO BACK AND HAVE TOLD MANY PEOPLE WHAT HAD HAPPENED.;632
387;I don't recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving.;528
388;I will come back here every time I'm in Vegas.;1068
389;This place deserves one star and 90% has to do with the food.;166
390;This is a disgrace.;145
391;Def coming back to bowl next time;424
392;If you want healthy authentic or ethic food, try this place.;372
393;I will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night ... highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area.;743
394;I have been here several times in the past, and the experience has always been great.;898
395;We walked away stuffed and happy about our first Vegas buffet experience.;312
396;Service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is Vegas and located inside the Crystals shopping mall by Aria.;747
397;To summarize... the food was incredible, nay, transcendant... but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser.;64
398;I'm probably one of the few people to ever go to Ians and not like it.;693
399;Kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos!;325
400;Service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see.;391
401;Cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable.;1010
402;This one is simply a disappointment.;31
403;Overall, I was very disappointed with the quality of food at Bouchon.;1021
404;I don't have to be an accountant to know I'm getting screwed!;1090
405;Great place to eat, reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the San Francisco Bay Area.;808
406;Today was my first taste of a Buldogis Gourmet Hot Dog and I have to tell you it was more than I ever thought possible.;734
407;Left very frustrated.;891
408;I'll definitely be in soon again.;191
409;Food was really good and I got full petty fast.;728
410;Service was fantastic.;1118
411;TOTAL WASTE OF TIME.;1036
412;I don't know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea.;712
413;Come hungry, leave happy and stuffed!;449
414;For service, I give them no stars.;1130
415;I can assure you that you won't be disappointed.;488
416;I can take a little bad service but the food sucks.;937
417;Gave up trying to eat any of the crust (teeth still sore).;923
418;But now I was completely grossed out.;705
419;I really enjoyed eating here.;595
420;First time going but I think I will quickly become a regular.;736
421;Our server was very nice, and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs, he stayed professional and friendly until the end.;507
422;From what my dinner companions told me...everything was very fresh with nice texture and taste.;1065
423;On the ground, right next to our table was a large, smeared, been-stepped-in-and-tracked-everywhere pile of green bird poop.;1119
424;Furthermore, you can't even find hours of operation on the website!;972
425;We've tried to like this place but after 10+ times I think we're done with them.;968
426;What a mistake that was!;944
427;No complaints!;83
428;This is some seriously good pizza and I'm an expert/connisseur on the topic.;1134
429;Waiter was a jerk.;473
430;Strike 2, who wants to be rushed.;377
431;These are the nicest restaurant owners I've ever come across.;465
432;I never come again.;656
433;We loved the biscuits!!!;669
434;Service is quick and friendly.;606
435;Ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes.;222
436;So absolutley fantastic.;446
437;It was a huge awkward 1.5lb piece of cow that was 3/4ths gristle and fat.;732
438;definitely will come back here again.;1128
439;I like Steiners because it's dark and it feels like a bar.;88
440;Wow very spicy but delicious.;232
441;If you're not familiar, check it out.;892
442;I'll take my business dinner dollars elsewhere.;965
443;I'd love to go back.;308
444;Anyway, this FS restaurant has a wonderful breakfast/lunch.;796
445;Nothing special.;437
446;Each day of the week they have a different deal and it's all so delicious!;389
447;Not to mention the combination of pears, almonds and bacon is a big winner!;1099
448;Will not be back.;752
449;Sauce was tasteless.;346
450;The food is delicious and just spicy enough, so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way.;4
451;My ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor.;754
452;I don't think we'll be going back anytime soon.;1001
453;Food was so gooodd.;204
454;I am far from a sushi connoisseur but I can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food.;708
455;I was so insulted.;1107
456;The last 3 times I had lunch here has been bad.;344
457;The chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat I have ever eaten.;1137
458;The food was very good and I enjoyed every mouthful, an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc.;835
459;Nargile - I think you are great.;741
460;Best tater tots in the southwest.;341
461;We loved the place.;1095
462;Definitely not worth the $3 I paid.;642
463;The vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole (choux) pastry was fresh enough.;867
464;Im in AZ all the time and now have my new spot.;1012
465;The manager was the worst.;918
466;The inside is really quite nice and very clean.;476
467;The food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable.;813
468;I don't think I'll be running back to Carly's anytime soon for food.;557
469;This is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged, then another 35 minutes to get our food...and they kept forgetting things.;556
470;Love the margaritas, too!;769
471;This was my first and only Vegas buffet and it did not disappoint.;126
472;Very good, though!;106
473;The one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading.;792
474;Great pork sandwich.;1053
475;Don't waste your time here.;993
476;Total letdown, I would much rather just go to the Camelback Flower Shop and Cartel Coffee.;784
477;Third, the cheese on my friend's burger was cold.;298
478;We enjoy their pizza and brunch.;475
479;The steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked.;371
480;We had a group of 70+ when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully.;161
481;I LOVED it!;129
482;We asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didn't bring that either.;60
483;This place is a jewel in Las Vegas, and exactly what I've been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here.;883
484;Seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh.;821
485;The selection of food was not the best.;664
486;Delicious and I will absolutely be back!;1003
487;This isn't a small family restaurant, this is a fine dining establishment.;174
488;They had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and I liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle.;171
489;I dont think I will be back for a very long time.;873
490;It was attached to a gas station, and that is rarely a good sign.;774
491;How awesome is that.;1109
492;I will be back many times soon.;1129
493;The menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide!;602
494;Worse of all, he humiliated his worker right in front of me..Bunch of horrible name callings.;283
495;CONCLUSION: Very filling meals.;259
496;Their daily specials are always a hit with my group.;205
497;And then tragedy struck.;1023
498;The pancake was also really good and pretty large at that.;77
499;This was my first crawfish experience, and it was delicious!;39
500;Their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite.;661
501;Waitress was sweet and funny.;820
502;I also had to taste my Mom's multi-grain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing, fluffy, and delicious!;956
503;I'd rather eat airline food, seriously.;801
504;Cant say enough good things about this place.;480
505;The ambiance was incredible.;652
506;The waitress and manager are so friendly.;720
507;I would not recommend this place.;601
508;Overall I wasn't very impressed with Noca.;400
509;My gyro was basically lettuce only.;1027
510;Terrible service!;1022
511;Thoroughly disappointed!;296
512;I don't each much pasta, but I love the homemade /hand made pastas and thin pizzas here.;292
513;Give it a try, you will be happy you did.;513
514;By far the BEST cheesecurds we have ever had!;621
515;Reasonably priced also!;467
516;Everything was perfect the night we were in.;510
517;The food is very good for your typical bar food.;185
518;it was a drive to get there.;426
519;At first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe - nice ambiance, clean, friendly staff.;1
520;Anyway, I do not think i will go back there.;788
521;Point your finger at any item on the menu, order it and you won't be disappointed.;98
522;Oh this is such a thing of beauty, this restaurant.;27
523;If you haven't gone here GO NOW!;952
524;A greasy, unhealthy meal.;924
525;first time there and might just be the last.;1047
526;Those burgers were amazing.;193
527;Similarly, the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late.;536
528;And it was way to expensive.;751
529;Be sure to order dessert, even if you need to pack it to-go - the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for.;417
530;This was my first time and I can't wait until the next.;610
531;The bartender was also nice.;552
532;Everything was good and tasty!;908
533;This place is two thumbs up....way up.;1006
534;The best place in Vegas for breakfast (just check out a Sat, or Sun.;213
535;If you love authentic Mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting, yet delicious meats to choose from, you need to try this place.;11
536;Terrible management.;1032
537;An excellent new restaurant by an experienced Frenchman.;888
538;If there were zero stars I would give it zero stars.;387
539;Great steak, great sides, great wine, amazing desserts.;1024
540;Worst martini ever!;980
541;The steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at GC.;352
542;I had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas!;958
543;We waited for thirty minutes to be seated (although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting).;57
544;The yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh.;1007
545;I won't try going back there even if it's empty.;124
546;No, I'm going to eat the potato that I found some strangers hair in it.;358
547;Just spicy enough.. Perfect actually.;52
548;Last night was my second time dining here and I was so happy I decided to go back!;275
549;not even a 'hello, we will be right with you.';453
550;The desserts were a bit strange.;861
551;My boyfriend and I came here for the first time on a recent trip to Vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service.;506
552;I really do recommend this place, you can go wrong with this donut place!;109
553;Nice ambiance.;790
554;I would recommend saving room for this!;954
555;I guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful.;703
556;However, my recent experience at this particular location was not so good.;62
557;I know this is not like the other restaurants at all, something is very off here!;1039
558;AVOID THIS ESTABLISHMENT!;244
559;I think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough.;337
560;All of the tapas dishes were delicious!;542
561;I *heart* this place.;940
562;My salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of Palm.;985
563;After two I felt disgusting.;804
564;A good time!;87
565;I believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi.;701
566;Generous portions and great taste.;926
567;I will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone!;679
568;The servers went back and forth several times, not even so much as an 'Are you being helped?';32
569;Food was delicious!;721
570;AN HOUR... seriously?;497
571;I consider this theft.;156
572;Eew... This location needs a complete overhaul.;68
573;We recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well.;655
574;Waited and waited and waited.;1151
575;He also came back to check on us regularly, excellent service.;1044
576;Our server was super nice and checked on us many times.;483
577;The pizza tasted old, super chewy in not a good way.;2
578;I swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed.;276
579;Service was good and the company was better!;823
580;The staff are also very friendly and efficient.;791
581;As for the service: I'm a fan, because it's quick and you're being served by some nice folks.;651
582;Boy was that sucker dry!!.;401
583;Over rated.;950
584;If you look for authentic Thai food, go else where.;362
585;Their steaks are 100% recommended!;180
586;After I pulled up my car I waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged.;411
587;Great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting.;48
588;All in all, I can assure you I'll be back.;1069
589;I hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives.;518
590;My breakfast was perpared great, with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of Toast, lightly dusted with powdered sugar.;1042
591;The kids play area is NASTY!;196
592;Great place fo take out or eat in.;390
593;The waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for vegan/veggie options.;25
594;OMG I felt like I had never eaten Thai food until this dish.;281
595;It was extremely 'crumby' and pretty tasteless.;614
596;It was a pale color instead of nice and char and has NO flavor.;167
597;The croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus.;265
598;I got home to see the driest damn wings ever!;920
599;It'll be a regular stop on my trips to Phoenix!;1071
600;I really enjoyed Crema Café before they expanded. I even told friends they had the BEST breakfast.;187
601;Not good for the money.;237
602;I miss it and wish they had one in Philadelphia!;625
603;We got sitting fairly fast, but, ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order, another 30 minutes before the food arrived.;318
604;They also have the best cheese crisp in town.;876
605;Good value, great food, great service.;522
606;Couldn't ask for a more satisfying meal.;468
607;The food is good.;413
608;It was awesome.;405
609;I just wanted to leave.;239
610;We made the drive all the way from North Scottsdale... and I was not one bit disappointed!;249
611;I will not be eating there again.;872
612;!....THE OWNERS REALLY REALLY need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one!;1011
613;I checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed.;772
614;The chicken I got was definitely reheated and was only ok, the wedges were cold and soggy.;47
615;Sorry, I will not be getting food from here anytime soon :(;430
616;An absolute must visit!;461
617;The cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing.;594
618;My friend did not like his Bloody Mary.;689
619;Despite how hard I rate businesses, its actually rare for me to give a 1 star.;725
620;They really want to make your experience a good one.;9
621;I will not return.;1142
622;I had the chicken Pho and it tasted very bland.;994
623;Very disappointing!!!;818
624;The grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning.;448
625;a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food, but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait.;756
626;Pretty awesome place.;773
627;Ambience is perfect.;49
628;Best of luck to the rude and non-customer service focused new management.;305
629;Any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one.;408
630;I asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored I went to the hostess and got one myself.;841
631;The staff is always super friendly and helpful, which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby!;758
632;Four stars for the food & the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe & still letting us in to eat !;160
633;The roast beef sandwich tasted really good!;397
634;Same evening, him and I are both drastically sick.;206
635;High-quality chicken on the chicken Caesar salad.;58
636;Ordered burger rare came in we'll done.;8
637;We were promptly greeted and seated.;1054
638;Tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse.;797
639;I was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar, not only because the quality is great, but the service is fast and the food, impeccable.;493
640;After waiting an hour and being seated, I was not in the greatest of moods.;586
641;This is a good joint.;490
642;The Macarons here are insanely good.;696
643;I'm not eating here!;91
644;Our waiter was very attentive, friendly, and informative.;378
645;Maybe if they weren't cold they would have been somewhat edible.;886
646;This place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver.;432
647;Very bad Experience!;46
648;What a mistake.;911
649;Food was average at best.;1015
